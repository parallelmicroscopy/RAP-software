guide to starting (all in terminal):

installing requirements:
pip install -r requirements.txt
npm install

running tests:
pytest
npm test

'pytest' tests the functionality in the vimba_rap3.py file while 'npm test' tests the interactivecls.js file. These two make up the
majority of the "thinking" in the project.
